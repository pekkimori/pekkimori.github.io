As a dedicated Computational Sciences and Neuroscience student at Minerva University, I have built a strong foundation in programming and research through roles as a Peer Tutor and an Undergraduate Researcher at IMPA. I have led multiple projects from concept to execution, including developing an AI-integrated robot to assist neurodivergent individuals and creating a web platform for over 2,000 users that cut event costs by 40%. A Silver Medalist in Brazil's National Mathematics Olympiad, my technical skills range from full-stack development and robotics to electronics and firmware engineering.
