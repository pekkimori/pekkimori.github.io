description: This abstract concept have been showing up in my mind and around me very often. I feel like it deserves some attention.

## Introduction

Recently, I've realized that one of the things that drives me is the need for hope that the world has today. And maybe, always has had. This was something I hadn't paid much attention to. I used to see my teachers telling the story of Pandora's box and how hope is the last to die. And I'd think: "So dramatic, right?". Whenever something bad happened, people would cling to this abstract concept of hope and say: "It won't go away." And I'd think: why care about that? Why get so tangled up in negativity? Why need a word that doesn't even exist to stay alive?

I would say that, at that moment, I didn't have a good understanding of what hope meant. At the time, I thought hope assumed the world was already lost, that you were clinging to an image of something that could be, just a hypothesis. Something that wasn't present and that you wished was.

Come on, I thought it was ridiculous to deny reality the way it is, to cling to an illusion and walk the path believing that this illusion would one day become reality. Because, look, if there's one thing we cannot deny, it's what the world is at this exact moment; denying it is foolish, because it is what it is. No matter how much you imagine, it won't change the facts. Unless you bring it into the real world and it becomes reality, merely imagining will never change anything.

People with hope drag themselves through the cruelty of reality, trying to numb the pain, so that, in the end, nothing has changed. But you can die happy knowing you went after a so-called "good life." In the attempt to follow something unreal, you at least believed in something—something that was nothing more than a creation of your own head.

I believed that every argument should come from an observation. It should come from what reality is. And for that very reason, I thought the concept of hope was ridiculous. Because what makes you believe that reality is the cruelty you see so much, to the point that you need hope to keep moving forward? I thought the world was good, intrinsically good. Hope was unnecessary; after all, things were good, and whatever bad happened was just a deviation from the baseline. And being a baseline, one day that deviation would revert. Hope was a double lie: a lie that the world was bad, and a lie that, assuming the world is bad, it would become good. And if there was a value I wouldn't let go of for anything, it was honesty. Therefore, I hated thinking about hope. To me, it was useless. It was something that didn't exist; it was banal. Therefore, I didn't think about it.

## The game with no rules

And well, what foolishness. And how funny to think that today hope is one of my most powerful engines. I'd say a lot has changed from when I was a kid until today, definitely and obviously. And one of those changes is the idea that the world is good. So, do I think the world is bad? No. If you believe that, I'm telling you you're spending too much time on Twitter (or whatever you call it over there, X). I believe the world is neutral. After all, the concept of good changes according to perspective. I used to believe that what was good was obvious, you know? When I was a kid, I'd look at a waffle and think: "This is good, this is obvious. Whoever doesn't like this must have a problem, but then again, that's not my problem either." And what idiocy to think that there are other perspectives and that the concept of good and bad changes depending on the subject, right? Yeah, right, I didn't even think about that. I'd say I was a very self-centered person. And I didn't understand other people, not one bit.

There are people who argue that what is good is defined by whoever wins. And therefore, justice always wins. After all, the one who defines the concept of justice is the one who won. If we take it to that side, yes, the world is good and will always be good. But today my argument doesn't come from the eyes of the winner; it comes from the eyes of everyone. And if we were to think that way, there would be no consensus on good, no consensus on bad, no concept of good, no concept of bad. Nothing is universal for me to say that the whole world is. That's when I realized that starting from the observation of reality is, actually, very hard. Because there isn't one reality. There are infinite ones. And suddenly, what I thought was intrinsic to the world wasn't.

But, at the same time, this makes the world a bit more understandable. Free will makes more sense. "Mistakes" make more sense. "Hits" make more sense. And you must be wondering: why? Well, because we choose the meaning. Imagine you are playing a card game and people start playing cards randomly. They didn't explain the rules of the game, and you think: "I can't understand what a right move is, what a wrong move is. What should I do? What are they doing? Why did they do what they did?". And you start getting confused because nothing makes much sense; there's no evident pattern. And then someone goes over and tells you the rules of the game, whispering right in your ear, real soft: "There are no rules." Wow, now everything makes sense.

And now, the concept of hope makes total sense, because hope is believing. Starting from the fact that there is no norm in the world, you can define it in a way that is beautiful to you. Hope is that flame inside you that makes you fight for the unique beauty you saw in the world and for what it could be. It's the will to go out there and win, to believe in something, to stop being a water molecule in the ocean carried by the sea currents, to make the world what you want it to be. Following hope is the most beautiful and pure way for you to be, to act, to speak, to transmit, to express who you are. It is the most honest way to live. Hope isn't denying reality; hope is the tool, it's the nutrient that gives us the strength to create reality and what it means. Knowing that hope exists gives us the opportunity to sculpt our lives as if they were a work of art.

## The myth of fixed nature

Even though it's such a beautiful idea, it went against one of the beliefs I had: that everyone had a purpose. Everyone had an essence. I believed in what Aristotle said about this eudaimonia and teleology. And I thought: well, a pair of scissors was made to cut, right? You analyze the properties of the scissors and you know what it was made for.

I thought the same about humans. Well, there are people born with a talent to read, others with a talent to sculpt, others with a talent to run. And it's up to the person to discover what they are good at and move forward with their purpose. And the purpose of your life, then, in a simplified way, would be to seek your excellence. But that was a concept that changed quite a bit in my head. Because, even though I still believe in it, I think this perspective is a bit more pragmatic than fundamental.

There's something very interesting about life and everything that exists: nature always changes. This is something so obvious. You think: "That person's nature is to be X." Well, nature changes. The tree is born from a sprout, and from the tree grow branches, and from the branch grow leaves. The final construction is the result of a whole history that started from a point out of its control. After all, the one who planted the seed wasn't the tree. But the way the tree grew was through a choice—one that didn't go very far from where the tree was planted. But its shape is unique and individual. And I had greatly underestimated the potential reach of a human being. I didn't know the concept of neuroplasticity, for example. I didn't know the real effect of continuous and lasting effort. I didn't know how chaotic, complex, and random the universe is.

A person might be a bit slow, but with enough effort, they'll go far. A person can be born very talented, but if they sit on the couch all day, they might even go backwards. And look, after studying psychology, this became much clearer and more obvious; after all, everything in life is nature and nurture. Nurture that can be done by the individual or by external effects. And so it becomes clear: if you think about what the world is, well, the world is also a mix; the world is nature and the world is nurture. The world is more complex than the point where it started. And if we go back to the scissors example? Well, maybe its nature really is to cut things, maybe that's the only way for it to reach its true excellence. However, my little sister might look at the scissors and make its purpose a decoration for the bookshelf, because she hasn't cut anything since the fifth grade, and so she cultivated a simple decoration.

And someone might think: "Well, but that's against its nature and it will never reach excellence." And I look at you and say: and since when is that its nature? Since you changed the nature of the metal and turned it into scissors. And since you thought of and placed this purpose on it. Because, in the end, our thinking might be wrong, because we also might not know very well what we think we know. You can say that a pig's purpose is to become food, to become gyudon. Well, there are many things a pig does that aren't becoming food. How can you point out to me that its purpose is to become food if it does (and can do) so many other things?

In this regard, I think Aristotle's theory isn't that wrong, but the way I had interpreted it, yes. It just happens that our eudaimonia is much bigger than just one thing. It expands from what you are today to everything you can be in the future.

## The courage to act

It's in these moments that I realize how dangerous the discourse of a nature, an intrinsic purpose, and an absolute and immutable truth is. Because, if there is no defined thing, if there is no intrinsic purpose, if there is no absolute truth, someone is preaching their concept onto you. Which opens the door for authoritarianism, for example.

All of this leaves a nagging question in the back of your mind. If there's no right, if there's no wrong, how do you know that the "right" in your head is the "right" that should go out into the world? And I answer you, simple: you don't. And that's exactly why you have to do it. Think with me: if you knew what the right thing was, well, then do it. Done. If you don't know what the right thing is, well, then do it anyway. After all, there's no way you can test to find out if you don't expose yourself. That's when I learned that everything I can become isn't closed up just inside me. Individualism doesn't end within my circle. I am what I am today because one day I was born from my father and my mother; I learned with my teachers; I talked and debated ideas with my friends; I fought with stupid people—as stupid as me.

If you think this way, it becomes easy to see that sometimes the right of the world is an amalgamation, it's a mix too. Not just what I think is right, but also what you think is right, what the other thinks is right, what everybody thinks is right. And maybe our duty is to have the courage to expose what we have inside us, knowing that sometimes we will be wrong, sometimes we will be right, and sometimes both will be screwing up. But then, build a good argument and don't go to battle vulnerable and naked. Bring a battalion with you. And expect the other guy to bring his battalion, and know that maybe he will win and maybe he is right, no matter how much you trained your soldiers. But know that your soldiers didn't die and, with your defeat, you will actually gain an even bigger army.

I believe that, at this moment, is when humility comes in, as a counterpart to courage. I had this dilemma before. Like, you have to be confident. You have to show people that you know what you're doing. But, at the same time, you have to show that you're humble. Which presumes you don't know what you're doing. How do I demonstrate to people that I know what I'm doing and don't know what I'm doing at the same time? How do I show confidence and humility at the same time? How am I confident without showing arrogance, and humble without showing foolishness?

Thinking about the whole argument built up to now, it becomes simple to answer this question. Because confidence isn't thinking you're always right (look at science, we don't know we are right, we only make super hyper educated guesses.) But it's knowing that you're there for a good reason; you're there with a battalion of arguments and evidences by your side. You don't know that you're 100 percent right, but you haven't lived until today for nothing. You didn't spend all this time thinking just to have something half-assed, something flaccid and dull. You're in the game. That is confidence. And humility is imagining that the other person isn't there for nothing either; they are alive just like you. So, you definitely have something to learn from them.

That's why it's not up to you to judge that the other person is a total piece of shit. Maybe, starting from your life's argument, he is a total piece of shit. And that he is going to get fucked in life. But remember that he is also alive. And if he's here, even being the piece of shit you think he is, it's because he has something that you don't know or don't understand. And maybe, on the day you understand it, you'll change your mind and realize that the words you said turned against you. But, again, that doesn't stop you from showing the world what you think. Because maybe he really doesn't know what he's doing. And, again, this is a battle with no predefined winner, no right or wrong. And actually, you are not battling against each other. Maybe that's why a battle isn't the best metaphor. You are battling together to live a better life and create an exceptional world. The battle is just a friendly match. It's my thesis against your antithesis, so that both of us generate our synthesis.

## Conclusion

In the end, despite having misunderstood what hope meant, deep down, I think I clung to it, because I didn't live a perfect life myself when I was a kid. In truth, I wanted hope to be unnecessary and I created a justification for it. Because I didn't want the world to suffer so much, nor for me to suffer so much. And hope only exists when there is suffering. But I was also a person who held on to it and I don't regret it one bit. Because I didn't sit around waiting for the world around me to improve on its own. And for that reason, I get so frustrated with a world that stays still, watching and seeing bad things happen.

Maybe, just like me when I was a kid, people think there is no hope, or that the world is bad, or whatever it actually isn't. That doesn't exist. You have to get moving. You can't stay still. It's obvious that everybody wished there was a superhero; I myself, as a kid, wanted someone to bring justice. Everyone looks at the story of the princess trapped in the castle waiting for the prince to rescue her. And look, I think that's pure bullshit. What a messed-up idea they planted in people's heads. There's no way a superhero will exist to bring all the good to the universe while you are sitting there living your mediocre life. That won't happen because your concept of good is only inside you. You have to be your own superhero.

I'm writing this not expecting many people to read it, but rather as a reflection for myself.[^1] Despite whatever bad things might happen, it doesn't matter. Because I know I did my best and, therefore, I will always improve. And I see that this is taking me to incredible places. And I see that the people around me who choose to be by my side, are becoming happier, more beautiful, more honest, and loving more – and that includes myself! Living is so good! And isn't that beautiful? It means I am cultivating the most precious thing in the universe.

The reason is that some of my friends wanted to see it raw, only with some minor grammar and punctuation corrections – and of course, the direct translation. I thought why not, I mean, I'm quite tired right now so I'm okay with that. This took me around ~2h45 to finish. If you are interested in going deeper in some of the philosophy behind this, check teleology and eudaimonia (Aristotle); existentialism and the concept of bad-faith (Jean-Paul Sartre); dialetics (Hegel); passive and active nihilism, and perspectivism (Friederich Nietzsche); pragmatism (William James); absurdism (Albert Camus).
