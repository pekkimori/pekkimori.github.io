description: I went through a lot of stuff the past few months. Let's look at the bright side.
---
## Introduction

In the last four months, I went through two mental breakdowns. To give some context:

- I do almost all of my work on a computer, and since a few months ago, I didn't have my own; I'd use loaners, and I had to return my usual loaner before moving to Tokyo. 

- At the beginning of the Fall semester, my mom went through a hysterectomy, with a chance of her having a tumour, so she couldn't work for a while. 

- I had multiple projects to work on at the same time, and as I always had financial struggles, I didn't have time or money to sustain myself or buy a laptop for my school/work. 

- I fought with my ex, and things ended up worse than before. 

- I passed out from burnout before a deadline during assignment week, so I couldn't submit a few assignments. 

- I got a severe case of the flu, which left me in bed for two weeks; I had absences that my university didn't excuse, therefore, my grades went downhill. 

All that happened in the first two to three months, and there is much more to say, things that happened afterwards, which I will address later in this post.

Now, this is not about me complaining about the bad things that happened to me (at least partially). I'll first tell my story, but my main goal here is to show how these moments drastically changed who I am, plus that there is something to learn here, in case someone who is also going through a lot may read this, giving them some direction and hope that things will get better.

## Who I was during the first crisis

I will share a text I wrote to myself during that first period. I went through all those things, and I snapped once I saw the presentation of a friend talking about how life is simple: it is about being happy, you should stop doing things that you don't like, and do things that you enjoy, like dancing, singing, drawing, and baking cookies.

I'm pretty sure that person never had a gun pointed at her when she was a kid because her father was going to jail, never walked to school just to eat lunch, never stuffed pillows to help their parents pay for electricity, nor searched for donated books to self-study in a school lacking teachers.

You may notice how my thoughts were cloudy, that I couldn't keep my argument or my sentences straight, and that I definitely didn't have any filter on, *haha.* However, I want you to pay attention to my mindset, I believe it was crucial to my later improvement.

>Thinking I have no control over myself makes me angry. Imagine you are a fucking powerhouse capable of anything you want if you're well-directed, and then "fire!" But it's not only about wanting it to happen; obviously, you have to go there and do it. But there are thousands of ?!?!?!?!?! trying to pull you, push you, deviate you, make your work even harder, and then suddenly, ?!?!?, it's raining, and you can't fire.
>
>Hence, it's not just about pointing and shooting, we have to do a lot of ?!?!, and then you realize, ?!?!, I cannot handle it.
>
>Then what, give up?
>
>The hard thing is that you can't give up because all of those ?!?!?!?!?!?!?! will always be there. The rain will still drop, and you only removed your goal by giving up; now there's no meaning left.
>
>So there's no way in this ?!?!. You have to shoot, be it crooked, wet, ?!?!?!, until you hit this ?!?!?!?! goal. Then, when that happens, nothing else can make you struggle because what you wanted happened, I think. But it's so difficult.
>
>At the moment I feel like ?!?!, like I was born in the wrong place, took the wrong decisions, and that all of the consequences of my actions will pursue me forever. It's not like I have infinite retries; every mistake of mine is one extra ?!?!?!?!?!?! or a failure in the system. Then it feels like I have to be perfect. And man, we can't be perfect. And I'm really tired of trying. Must be because I'm getting old. My neuroplasticity is shrinking, and that kind of stuff. I don't want to learn anymore. I just wanted to win.
>
>Obviously, this is an illusion. I was not born in a first-world country, in a rich family. I cannot be happy, dumb, and inconsequent. I have to improve, learn, get a hold of all of those ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!, be waterproof. ?!?!?!?!?!? The worst is when I try, but not even my body would help me. It doesn't understand that I live in a stone jungle between buildings, grinding and hustling.
>
>Now let's be rational. Is it worth it to adapt to the problem or to get rid of it? It's hard to choose because both of them take your freedom in their own way. Look, if you adapt yourself, you lose your freedom forever, stuck inside the lines of that problem, but you learn how to deal with it, live with the constraint, giving you freedom of goal, but not of path. Now, if you get rid of the problem, you get free overall, you get rid of the constraint, get freedom of path, but it will definitely come again later, and you'll have to get rid of it again, or you'll have to learn how to deal with it (the former option); otherwise, you won't get where you want to go.
>
>But in the real world, it's never one or the other. It's always a little bit of both. It's a balance. The ideal would be to know how to handle things when you need to, get rid of problems most of the time, and prevent them when they could arise.
>OK, maybe the ?!?!?!?!?!?!?! were dealt with. However, we still have natural disasters, a body that decides to get nervous, anxious, and not shoot, and unconsciously tries to kill itself in 1000 different ways (metaphorically).
>
>Then I'm cooked.
>
>"How to deal with auto sabotage", I think that's my biggest concern. Sincerely, I'm capable of anything when I'm not ?!?!?!?! myself over, because I'm really, really capable of ?!?!?!?! myself over.
>
>Nothing's impossible, so even if I protect myself from myself, I will still be able to ?!?! me over, but I could also create ways to avoid that.
>
>First, I could grab an umbrella. I don't know exactly where I'm trying to get with this, but I should create a system that prevents the bad moments from affecting me so negatively – metaphorically, having an umbrella to protect me from the rain when it rains. For example, if I eventually get suicidal thoughts, I shouldn't be awake so late in the night, and I shouldn't starve for days. Another example: if I'm tired, I should be able to do what should be done.
>
>The second thing is to make it not rain at all, which looks difficult and impossible. It is more about "delaying" than "preventing". In this case, I could take care of myself, which is not hard nor even impossible, and it does save much trouble.
>
>And last, to not stay where it rains. Change my environment so that I don't need to make so many adjustments. And so I'll be able to focus on what's more important. Again, if I can avoid problems, better.
>
>But what if there is no evident better or worse when choosing between one problem and another to tackle? Well, I think it depends on whether you're going to suffer the most with one or the other in the long run. But think carefully if you're not just increasing your problems. Think about the adaptation dilemma.

You can see that I was confused, but I was trying to understand the situation and find a solution. 

Something that I should be grateful for my ex (the one I fought). I remember the words echoing through my mind, something along the lines of: "I don't care about your reasons or excuses, I just want you to find a way to not hurt me anymore." 

*Ugh, but powerful.*

## The intermission

But that didn't matter much anymore, because I had moved on a few months ago (yeah, we fought again a few months after the breakup), and I had a new girlfriend! The winter break arrived; I had survived all the obstacles, and my life was sorting itself out again. 

I met her in Japan, and I was very happy with her. So much that I tried my best not to make the same mistakes I made with the previous ones, and to put extra effort into showing how much I loved and cared.

That gave birth to a love letter, which I gave to her after we discovered her dad had cancer (and that all her family already knew it, and that they were hiding it from her specifically, and that she discovered it by accident. $\text{Holy ?!?!}\times 3$)

I wanted to let her know that there was still hope and love in the world for her. Even after all of the bad things that happened to her.

>Dear チュングス (Chungus),
>
>How are you? I know your life is quite complicated right now, but I hope that you are managing to stay positive. I am actually very grateful that you share your pains, problems, and concerns with me. Following this line, I think it's fair to express my feelings and let you see inside my troubled mind too. Because I overthink a lot, I thought a letter would be perfect. Again, I wrote this down when my mind was being loud, and I even took off and rephrased many unnecessary stuff that were buzzing around, so you don't need to feel it as intensely as I wrote it![^1]
>
>So, I was a little bit sad. Usually, I would say it's just my lack of sleep, but I realized that it only highlights my current emotions, sometimes bottled up in my chest. I was somewhat frustrated that the decisions I make often end up hurting me. In a ranking of the people who did me dirty, I'm #1 (which, honestly, isn't true, but I like thinking I'm responsible for the things that happen in my life). The path I took brought me many victories, but even so, they were painful to achieve, and it took many wrong turns to get the right one. On many occasions, discomfort was unavoidable. But not all of them.
>
>Then, why not choose an easier life and avoid the extra, unnecessary complications? Why won't I just go dog mode and go ?!?!?!? around, humping trees or something like that, as it is easier? Well, I want to live by my standards, my values, and my categorical imperative! Also, I want to live a super amazing life, one that is deep, interesting, and unforgettable. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the daily, mundane things or the lows of life; actually, they fill my life with joy more than some grandiose moments, and I'm reminded every day of how important and good they are, and they are all part of an amazing life, like, just hugging at the park at night in a cold windy Friday can sparkle great feelings in me. In the end, I don't regret any of my choices because I know I couldn't find a deeper meaning any other way.
>
>I'm someone who lives in the future; I need to put effort into enjoying the present and being grateful for the past, not forgetting it. And that is probably the reason I suffer so much with farewells; it means that there isn't a shared future anymore, it means the end of a present to enjoy with that person, and it means that one day, I'll start to forget their voice, their scent, and the color of their eyes. Adding to that, because I have an anxious ass, I start overthinking, imagining all scenarios of things that could go wrong, getting scared of random shit in the future, and then I may get scared over something that might happen in the distant future and get feeling like a broccoli jelly. I think you noticed it by how many times I had anxiety crises in my technical interviews.
>
>There is a terrifying word for me, from the Boro language of India, that I was scared of, as it hurt me quite a few times. They refer to it as "Onsra"; it describes the bittersweet feeling or moment when you realize your love is ending, or that you are loving for the very last time. Realistically, I know a long-distance relationship is terrifyingly hard. That's why I was feeling anxious that the "see you later" in April could slowly transform into a "goodbye." I can't even guarantee that I'll be able to live in Japan or Canada in two years, even if I want it that badly.
>
>But then I remembered a beautiful word in Brazilian Portuguese that I really like. We refer to it as "Saudade": a deep, nostalgic longing to be near someone or something distant again, or to be near that which has been loved and lost—the love that remains. If one day that ever happens, I really just want to know that you'll be happy throughout the time we spend together, and that if one day we say our farewells, you'll think about me just like this, that you feel saudade, and that even if it hurts when you think about it, you don't regret even one second. If I get to be like that, I'll know that whatever the outcome, it will all have been worth it.
>
>You know, チュングス, we only dated for a month or so; you probably don't even understand me that well yet, and I don't know you that well either. Perhaps you think I'm too clingy or too intense because of that; that's why I usually keep those thoughts to myself, repress them, and say I just want to live the moment. But what I'm trying to say right now is that you're special to me, and from what I know of you, I want to learn much more and create so many great moments with you. We are still getting to know each other, and it feels awesome!
>
>When I think about what would make me happy and what would enable me to live an amazing life, I find that I can't escape philosophy. Nietzsche said that eternity is not something outside our reality. Thinking about time (past, present, and future), he believes in the concept of "eternal return," which is a very misleading name.
>It is not eternal, because nothing lasts forever. And it won't return, because we can't go back in time. What he means by that is that genuine eternity lives in the present, when we wish that the moment never ends, and that we could go back to it again and again. For me, in an amazing life, I'm not living it just as a means to reach greatness at the end, in something like heaven; I strive for a life that, if I had to choose, I would relive again and again, in an eternal return.
>
>When I was in my previous relationships, I got attached because I thought the pain meant it was real, then I let them go, because nothing real could be so painful.[^2] But チュングス, in you, I saw the opportunity to live something amazing and real. Every moment I spend with you, I want to be with you just a little longer, and then I always look forward to talking to you later, or seeing you again next week.
>
>(...) [^3]
>
>Before, I was just feeling anxious about the future, which was silly. We are just beginning our journey together. We can't control the flow of time and life, and that is OK; that's just the way things go. It only hurts when we try to deny it and try to control everything. The universe is chaotic, and we have no other choice but to accept it as it is. After all, we don't even know what is going to happen in the middle from here to there!
>
>Many times, we'll have to face difficult choices, the ones that have no right or wrong, no better or worse. But those are the decisions that shape who we are for real, and, independent of what we choose, it's our responsibility to make the best of them as much as possible.
>
>So in the end, what matters is that I love you a lot, and there is something in you that makes you irreplaceable and unique to my eyes. And certainly for that reason alone, it would be enough for me to be a silly baka, get all of my feelings bottled up deep in my heart, pour everything out to you, and believe, not as a hope or expectation that it will be alright, but as a wish and determination that we will make it the best together!

## The second crisis

Suddenly, the concerns that were lurking around caught me.
That had never happened to me, and I didn't know what to do. My anxiety levels went up again, and my conditions worsened again.

She distanced herself, taking long to reply, and apathetically when doing so. Things were out of my control again, and soon, I felt powerless, for not being able to help or make her feel better, all I could do was send her messages to check if she was eating and sleeping; and of course, make myself available for whatever she needed. 

We spent one month in this dynamic, the only meaningful messages I got were: "I feel guilty for making you wait", and "Thank you for not abandoning me." I felt like things were going to break again.

Then, we finally met to talk properly.

In short, she didn't have the energy or time for a relationship anymore, even though she wanted to be with me. She felt guilty of only interacting with me when she was in the mood.

I thought ending it was perfectly reasonable, even though it was not exactly what I wanted – I wanted to be there for her when she needed the most, when she was vulnerable and at her lowest. I just hoped that decision would be the best for her. So we decided it was better to break up. 

She left me with a request: "Please, just don't forget me."

Of course, I'm not a robot, even though rationally it was all reasonable, I was emotionally destroyed:

>You know, things don't always work out or happen the way we expect, and that uncertainty is one of life's most basic certainties. I made the decision to stay with her, but unfortunately, the universe decided it wasn't meant to be right now. It's not the end of everything; I am overflowing with opportunities and good things for the future, and that is wonderful. I just feel that, alone, all these stories are dull.
>
>I don't depend on another person to be entirely happy, but that is, in the end, a lie I have told myself many, many times. I told it to give myself a sense of control, to feel that my joy depended on me and me alone, but that is only true up to the point where it becomes a lie:
>
>I can go to the aquarium and see the beauty of the fish swimming, but that beauty dies in the soul if there is no one to share it with and reminisce. I can adore Kirby, enjoy his games, buy his plushies, and admire his image in infinite ways; however, it is undeniable that Kirby wasn't my invention. Many people built what he represents today, so I can enjoy it. I can be rich and wealthy, eat well, sleep well, have everything material that I achieved through sheer grit, working hard, suffering, after going through hell—but if I went through it all alone, just for myself, then my life, in the end, was a zero-sum game that amounted to nothing.
>
>What I wanted most in life, actually, is a partner—like Rocket and Groot, like Finn and Jake, like the Boy and the Blob, like Shaggy and Scooby, like Mike Wazowski and Sulley, like SpongeBob and Patrick, like Luffy and Zoro, or even the whole Straw Hat crew... I wanted someone to share the moments, to bring meaning to life's suffering, to bring beauty to life's pleasure, to love and be loved, to make life more alive.
>
>Look, I have friends and a family that supports me; I am not entirely alone, but my path diverges greatly. I don't stay still, and I fly far and fast. So much so that I leave these people behind; I don't end up alone, but I end up lonely. My journey has been full of goodbyes. Until now, no one has set off on this adventure with me. Every time a new connection was created, after a short time, I already had one foot out the door, lonely again.
>
>I started thinking that my mission in this universe is to keep moving forward, to be a comet leaving a trail of light between the planets and the cosmos. All that remains with me is knowing that, wherever I passed, I managed to make that world more colorful. It is the memory that we were happy, the gratitude for having passed through there, and knowing that I left behind the hope that they can be much more than they are, and that, one day, they might follow my path.
>
>The universe doesn't let me get comfortable, because if it did, there would be no reason to keep going; I would land on the pink planet and stay there forever. But I was born to do more than that; I was born to be great, to fly far, to shine bright. I didn't receive all this love, all this talent, all these opportunities, to stay still and burn in the shadow of the pink planet. I only see the world's disgrace, the tragedy, the poorly corrected mistake, and the beautiful things hidden in the chaos, because I have the power to change it and bring out its inner beauty, to give hope. I know the universe made me feel things so intensely, so I would never forget, so that this connection becomes a harpoon that hooks into me, and while I am flying through the sky, far away, I will guide all those who left a mark on me. This is my responsibility to the universe.
>
>I am a shooting star destined to be admired from afar. And maybe that isn't bad; I think it couldn't be any other way, because that is who I am, and this pain wouldn't mean anything if it didn't exist. I can only say thank you to all the people who told me to keep going. Thank you, universe, for guiding me. I will keep moving forward. And I won't forget.
>
>Anyway, when the moment comes, maybe one day, I'll find my pair, and finally, the universe will say it's our time to stop; so I can look back, see the sky with pride, see my story written by the comet's trail as if it were chalk, and say: "Alright guys, now it's time to move on, let's go?" and then would come the meteor shower.
>
>>Discovered in 1826, Biela's Comet was a short-period comet that orbited the Sun every 6.6 years.
>>
>>During its appearance in 1846, astronomers were shocked to see that the comet had split in two. It was no longer a single object but a "double comet"—two distinct comets (Comet A and Comet B) travelling side-by-side through space, connected by a faint bridge of material.
>>
>>The pair returned in 1852, still travelling together but drifting further apart. After that, they were never seen again. The double comet had completely disintegrated.
>>
>>In 1872 and 1885, on the dates when the comet was supposed to pass, the sky was instead filled with a spectacular meteor storm. Observers reported seeing thousands of meteors ("falling stars") per hour—some estimates reached 3,000 per hour. The comet had physically broken apart into a stream of debris that burned up in Earth's atmosphere.

Well, the text might sound narcissistic, though it is not that I believe I am the only greatest one, but I felt like my conditions led me to behave like that.

Of course, I felt like we broke up on good terms. I didn't want to lose another good friend again because of a breakup. After writing that, I sent her a message that I was thankful for everything, and that I'd be happy to keep a friendship. She agreed. 

On that same day, I realized that while I was writing that text to myself, she had reactivated her Instagram account; she posted a picture of herself drinking hard, and another getting undressed and hugging another man in her room. It all happened in the span of four days.

## Double down!
I felt betrayed. One month trying my best to support her, she never took my hand, she said she didn't have time, not even for herself, and suddenly, she had time to do all that ?!?!. Not only that, but ?!?! that was completely out of her character.

I was so confused; I didn't know what was real anymore. I doubted everything that happened, what was said, who she really was, and who I previously committed to. I called her to get some answers, but she was half-asleep and talking like a brain-dead snail: "Huh?" "yeah" "what?..." "no..." "uhm". She didn't say anything at first, thought I didn't know about the post, then deactivated the account again, then claimed she wasn't looking for another relationship, then got defensive once I told her I'd seen the post... Not that it mattered anymore. She eventually declared hooking up with the random guy only after the breakup, and that she wasn't lying about anything. Didn't know what to believe or not. I was just engulfed in anger. I said I was glad she found what was best for her and that she should keep doing what's best, but I didn't want to talk anymore.

I've only felt so shocked once before; it was like going through hell again. From thinking the universe just took the best girl from me, to thinking that maybe the universe was actually protecting me.

I wrote several bullet points on how to choose a better girl next time and how to protect my feelings. Still, I was so confused. Maybe someone with more experience will say that I was a fool, and she just lacks character, that I deserve better. And to be honest, I agree, I do know I tried my best and was holding my most precious values to heart, and behaving accordingly, but at the same time, the questions wouldn't stop.

Was I there just to fill a hole? 

Did she actually love me? 

Was she that proud of what she did, to the point of showing it to everyone? 

Was she actually a person who cared and tried to be responsible? 

Was I giving my heart the wrong take? 

Was I useful or helpful at all? 

Did I just waste one month's worth of love and time? 

Did I ever know her even a little? 

Was I the one in an illusion this whole time?

Why would this happen if I did the right thing? 

If my mom died, would I still be myself?

If it's not my fault, could I really say it's her fault?

While I was practicing gratitude to cope with my feelings, she practiced alcoholism and sex; Is this how much I was worth, less than that?

I was spiraling down and down. But something held me up. I realized that gratitude, love, kindness, honesty, integrity, temperance, thoughtfulness, and hope – things that were hard to nourish at first but that I didn't give up on, even when I had second thoughts – genuinely helped me feel better and more satisfied with myself. I didn't feel guilt or regret; I was OK. Even after all that happened, I could look at myself in the mirror and say that it's not my fault, that I did great, because I didn't succumb to revenge. I was somehow filled with a higher sense of responsibility for those values. The universe didn't shove them onto me; I willingly chose them. Thus, I decided to write another letter, one that was never sent.

>チュングス, if all you ever do is run away from the pains and then indulge yourself in something, you will actually become good at it, so much so that you will end up running away from everyone and devouring everything there is, becoming alone and empty, just like the people who hurt you. Sometimes, you gotta face it, be strong, and think when it's time to fight, to resist, to argue what's really healthier for you.
>
>You know, チュングス, I don't see you as a woman anymore, I see you as a kid. Right now, you are too emotionally immature and can't even take care of yourself. Even though I loved you, I can't love you as I did. My heart is important to me, and I wouldn't put something important in the hands of a kid, especially someone who can't take care of things. I can't give you my heart anymore. I deserve peace.
>
>We both know you didn't do most things or say those excuses out of pure love; you were scared of letting me into your life. You grew more and more scared the more you loved, and the more things fell apart around you. Then you tried to lie to yourself, telling yourself you didn't love it or need it.
>
>Unfortunately, チュングス, changing won't fix things or heal our wounds. But you will grow. Ask for forgiveness, make sure you don't repeat those mistakes, and forgive yourself. And then, life will slowly improve.

All I hoped was to see her recover from the grief, hear apologies, give her a big hug, say thank you again, and part our separate ways.

I chose to believe that she isn't just an evil goblin that cheated and lied, because I remember the details, and they make me believe. Still, I don't expect what I wish will happen. It's sad, but it's okay.

## Conclusion

After everything that happened, I felt like a new person. Broken and reconstructed.

I'm still not able to explain why, but my social anxiety almost vanished. It felt like people's actions and opinions didn't truly reflect who I was; I didn't trust their words as much anymore. I had lots of motivation to follow through with my projects, work, and school; they all felt so meaningful and purposeful, and I have found a new reason to move forward. I no longer feel unhappy with my personal life; I actually have so many amazing people in my life, so many good things overflowing and coming. I just never gave the proper attention to the things I achieved.

One year ago, I was asked this question: "Define who you are." My answer was something along the lines of "Nerd, weird, clumsy." I don't even know why I said clumsy. I'd try to bullshit something in interviews, about how I cared deeply about something beautiful at the front, which I didn't really care that much about. I just moved forward because I wanted to put my family out of that ?!?!?! hole in Brazil, live a comfortable life, and have fun.

But today I can say that I looked at that black hole and said: "I'll illuminate this galaxy, it doesn't matter how much light you drain!", that I stared at the demon's face and said: "I am going after you. I'll be the one out there to get you." I know it can be naive or dumb, but I don't want to live in a world where that kind of suffering exists. I won't be part of that gruesome feedback loop; I want to break it. I want to live in a world full of love, joy, kindness, truth, hope, meaning, integrity, growth... I despise the fact that the universe can be this unfair, cruel, and stupid, and I won't be able to live with myself if I don't do anything about it. The universe didn't make me the comet out of nowhere; my mom and dad just wanted me to be good, study, and then do whatever I wanted to. Now I realize: ***I don't need to, I ought to be that FUCKING comet!!!*** AMOR FATI!!!

Falling apart wasn't the end. It was the destruction of my old self, of my old views, to build a new, improved version of myself. I once saw everything as the same, every value was equally good, every thought was equally valid, and I had no reason to bother or interfere because I was just the same... *NO!* It's not the same. I'm proud of my values because I believe in them, and I believe that they are right. All of that is not humbleness; it's weakness, it's being a coward. I want to be courageous enough to say that I disagree, that I am the way I am for a good reason, and that I refuse to let it die on me. This is what Dabrowski calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_disintegration" target="_blank">positive disintegration</a>.[^3]

...

If that person ever reads this, know that you were stoopid and I shouldn't have trusted you that much.

Like, why the heck would you post that?? Did you really need to break my illusion with a damn bazooka? Is this how you wanted me to not forget about you? *haha*

...

Phew...

But I forgive you, in respect for the good times. And I forgive myself for being a fool in limerence, after all, I started writing all this just to intellectualize my pain.

In the end, I'm just like you, fighting against this grief in our own ways, and posting something crazy on the internet. I just think what you did wasn't very nice.

Thank you for reading! (๑・ω-)～♥”[^4]

[^1]: For those curious about the things I took off. *(Notice those concepts might be wrongly defined, you should definitely double check with another resource if you want to take them seriously, however, this reflects my understanding of them):*

    Aristotle asserts that everything in the universe has a purpose, not imposed by someone or a god, but inherent in its own intrinsic characteristics, and what distinguishes it from others.
    
    A brush's purpose is to paint, while a hammer's purpose is to drive a nail into a surface. You can try hammering a nail with a brush, or painting a wall with a hammer, but that would be rather stupid.
    
    Part of living an extraordinary life means living in accordance with my purpose.

    Kant asserts that ethical decisions are based on the categorical imperative rather than the hypothetical imperative.
    
    An imperative means something that tells you what to do, for example: "Go touch some grass" is in the imperative form.
    
    Hypothetical here means in unique, specific scenarios or goals; therefore, we can say that the hypothetical imperative is what you should do in relation to certain occasions in life, for example: "you should go to the gym if you want to get stronger", "you should read more if you want to get smarter", "you should diet if you want to lose weight".
    
    Categorical here means that it is independent of the scenario; therefore, a categorical imperative is something that you should do, independent of the case, goal, person, outcome, whatever; the goodness is intrinsic in the action.
    
    Kant says that they can only be found through "goodwill." 
    
    As humans, we are the only ones able to reason; we are the only animals that have the freedom to do what we don't want to do, and to make those decisions, we think about them.
    
    In other words, our purpose is to go beyond our bare, raw nature of pleasure and pain; that is where the concept of "goodwill" originates.
    
    Therefore, the right thing to do is, through your own reasoning, find the thing that you believe that, for anyone and everyone, regardless of the outcome, should do exactly the same, because it is right, for example: "It makes sense to me that the right thing to do is being kind. Everyone should be kind to each other, because otherwise, if we were all mean to each other, we would simply destroy ourselves."
    
    Part of living an extraordinary life means living in accordance with my categorical imperative and my values.

[^3]: For those curious about the things I hid. *(They were in the original letter):*

    I love how you're so funny, like how you bring such unexpected jokes and monkey stickers to the conversation, how you get energetic and excited when you're talking about something gay, how you dress up cute, and, maybe it was just a coincidence, but you kept the ring piercing in your mouth after I said it was pretty, how you're not afraid to banter and get the jokes going even when I say something weird, how you start frenetically tiptoeing when we are kissing while standing, or how you're up to doing random stuff just for the sake of a laugh or trying it out. I can actually imagine myself sharing all the crazy lore we've built together with people and taking pride in it.
    
    I truly feel like I can be myself with you; I don't need to be making exceptions, putting things on a balance, sacrificing things, changing myself for your sake (and I mean, sometimes I do want improve and adjust, to be a better person for both of us, but it never came down to changing who I am for real, and it never felt tiring, actually, sometimes it is fun!), or agree with everything you say because otherwise I'll be equivalent to a piece of dried chewed gum stuck to a bathroom stall, on that note, you're so kind and forgiving that it makes me feel like I can be human again. It just feels so smooth being with you, and it's all so genuine to me that I want to be vulnerable in front of you and write my flaws to you in this letter. This makes me think that you truly love the real me, and not some illusion of how you wanted me to be.
    
    Of course, we had already experienced moments of conflict (and we will definitely have many more), we hurt each other, or faced problems that needed to be solved. Still, for some reason, they were resolved so quickly and easily that there was no problem to begin with. I was so accustomed to feeling drained and spending hours of my day apologizing and humiliating myself for something I said or something that happened, that when I realized I didn't need to be punished by someone else for those misunderstandings —that it was actually possible for us to face conflicts together, not against each other, to foster a better relationship for the sake of our own happiness, trusting that the other has a growth mindset, and that I can trust we will try our best to become a better person— I got so relieved that I met you. You gave me the hope of finding someone who behaves because they genuinely care and want to make the situation better, not because they are protecting their ego, running from discomfort, or just looking at their own belly button.

    (Yeah, I recommend reading the entire Wikipedia page to understand this.)
